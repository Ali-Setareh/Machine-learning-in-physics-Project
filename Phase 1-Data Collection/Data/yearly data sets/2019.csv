Frankie-Four-Eyes and his team, including Sophie as the driver, take on the newcomers: the mysterious and conceited Zac and his athletic cousin Charly. The fantastic sled designed by Frankie disintegrates right before crossing the finish line. It is a bitter loss for Frankie who refuses to accept that he might have made some building mistakes. Together with his friends, he manages to prove that Zac cheated during the race. Frankie demands a rematch; which Zac accepts on condition that Frankie build an entirely new race track. Frankie and his friends build a spectacular race track. Zac realizes he is up against a worthy opponent so he raises the stakes even more by cornering Frankie into betting the barn. As the two teams prepare for race day, Zac has no scruples about cheating even more to weight the outcome of the race in his favor. But Frankie and his team have a few surprises of their own in store for him."

",China,Mandarin,Trafalgar Releasing,"Come one, come all. On Thursday, August 1, join Dead Heads in your neighborhood - and around the world - when Trafalgar Releasing and Rhino Entertainment celebrate the 9th Annual Grateful Dead Meet-Up at the Movies. This can't-miss event - the first to go global - features the previously unreleased complete June 17, 1991 concert from Giants Stadium. Widely considered one of the greatest shows of the band's final decade of performing, 6/17/91 also sounds unlike any Dead show you've ever heard as it was one of only two recorded on 48-track. Mixed by Jeffr ey Norman in glorious surround sound with video from the multi-camera live edit, this will be the first time the Bruce Hornsby and Vince Welnick line-up has ever appeared on the big screen . Opening with a shocking ""Eyes Of The World,"" the Dead were firing on all cylinders from the opening notes of the show, mixing beloved classics like ""Truckin'"" and ""Uncle John's Band"" with rarities including ""Saint Of Circumstance,"" ""Might l MYAs bl,"" ""New Speedway Boogie,"" and ""China Doll."" But the real standout was the recurrence of ""Dark Star,"" which wove in and out of the setlist, making no less than six distinct appearances and teases during the show. The Dead capped off the spectacularly night with a perfect song to send the crowd on its way - The Band's ""The Weight."""

Smooth talking and seductive, Victor was raised to do one thing only, which is to kill for money. When he is sent to the home of a brutal drug lord to collect payment for his most recent hit, he encounters the beautiful Sarai (Alicia Sanz), who has been forced to spend the last 9 years of her life with the drug lord. After Victor leaves the compound, Sarai seizes her chance at freedom by hiding out in Victor's car. But things don't go as planned and instead of being transported back to her home, she finds herself free from one dangerous man only to be caught in the clutches of another. While on the run from the vengeful drug lord and his brutal henchmen, Victor's conscience catches up with him as he risks all that he stood for to protect his captive. In the end, the power Sarai unknowingly holds over Victor and their undeniable attraction may be what places her right in the arms of a killer."

",Canada,English,Fathom Events,"You Are Here - A Come From Away Story is an intimate feature documentary that goes deep into the community of Gander, Newfoundland where 38 airliners carrying over 6,500 passengers were forced to land after the terrorist attacks on 9/11. The film pulls back the emotional layers surrounding the five days during which the community housed, fed and cared for the dislocated passengers (or the ""come from aways"" in Newfoundland parlance). While their stories were the inspiration for the extraordinary Broadway hit musical, Come From Away, the documentary, You Are Here, reveals first-hand accounts of the great kindnesses and energetic resourcefulness the community showed their unexpected guests. Their emotional and sometimes humorous story of compassion and generosity, born of a long history of rescuing and welcoming shipwrecked sailors, resonates with a legacy of healing and reconciliation for the world - especially for the survivors of those murdered on 9/11, and for the first responders who lost their own lives saving others on that fateful day."

",Japan,Japanese,Fathom Events,"In the city of Orario, beneath an impossibly tall tower, lies the dungeon. Only adventurers who form partnerships with the gods themselves have any hope of defeating the monsters that lie within. But the dungeon is not the only place where monsters exist. Far from Orario, in the ruins of an ancient city, a new threat arises. To counter this threat, the goddess Artemis has come to Orario in search of a champion-but it's not Ais Wallenstein (the legendary Sword Princess) nor Ottar (the strongest warrior to ever enter the dungeon) that she chooses. Rather it is Bell Cranel, a newbie adventurer partnered with a low-tier goddess."

In the midst of all of this, another would-be suitor a Saraceb knight, Abderakhman (played by Gedeminas Taranda) makes a bid for the hand of Raymonda.

",UK,English,CineLife Entertainment,"This striking and moving documentary from BAFTA nominated directors Jacqui and David Morris traces the extraordinary life of Rudolf Nureyev. From his birth in the 5th class carriage of a trans-Siberian train, to his dramatic leap to freedom in the West at the height of the Cold War, and unprecedented adulation as the most famous dancer in the world. The film highlights Nureyev's unlikely yet legendary partnership with Margot Fonteyn and charts his meteoric rise to the status of global cultural phenomenon. Nureyev's life plays out like the sweeping plot of a classic Russian novel. His story is Russia's story. Blending never-before-seen footage, with an original score by award-winning composer Alex Baranowski and spellbinding newly choreographed dance tableaux directed by Royal Ballet alumnus, Russell Maliphant, Nureyev is a theatrical and cinematic experience like no other. This is a portrayal as unique as the man himself. There will never be another Nureyev."

She leads uneventful yet peaceful days at handling civil complaints and looking after her son and unemployed husband at home. One day, an overly enthusiastic detective Ji-Hye, is consigned to Mi-Young's team, and they bicker over every little thing from the moment they meet. In fact, they are sisters-in-law, and neither are happy about sitting next to each other all day in the same office. But differences are pushed aside when a woman who came to file a report gets run over in front of Mi-Young and Ji-Hye. They discover that the woman is the victim of 'spy cam porn' and was threatened it would go up on a community site in three days. The two cops take the case, but due to workload, no one can handle it in time. Ji-Hye's burning passion for justice rekindles Mi-Young's sense of duty, and the two decide to take matters into their own hands."

In desperation, he offers the great Constant Coquelin a new play, a heroic comedy, in verse, for the holidays. Only concern: it is not written yet. Ignoring the whims of actresses, the demands of his Corsican producers, the jealousy of his wife, the stories of his best friend's heart and the lack of enthusiasm of all those around him, Edmond starts writing this piece which nobody believes. For now, he has only the title: ""Cyrano de Bergerac""."

Charmed by the male employees, the girls fill out a job application and quickly become part of the 'Toy Depot' gang. Charlotte has found the guys to be particularly helpful in getting over her heartbreak, to say the least. But has she taken it too far? The film explores teenage girls' desires, the blurred lines between sex and friendship, and the unfair double standard imposed upon girls. It is a story of desire, self-censorship, and self-assertion."

",USA,English,Kino Lorber,"A few years after her mother's passing, 17-year old Tennie's reputation at school takes a major hit before the prom. To further complicate the daily rigors of teenage life, her father, Robert, an advertising executive who has since rebuilt his business, tries to do the same with his relationship with his daughter. Against his therapist's advice, overeager Robert tries really hard to get close to Tennie by showing his own way of caring. He tries to find out about his daughter's personal life with the help of his newly appointed, 19 year-old driver/intern, Jack. Practically being raised by her extended family, Tennie although very academically inclined and mature for her age, with compassion for others, she's got a touch of sarcasm, and a hint of rebelliousness. After she catches on to her father's plan, Tennie realizes that in order to get her father off of her back, she needs to convince him to find a lady friend. She recruits her friends to create an online dating profile in order to introduce her father to potential companions. Little did she know that her father already was seeing someone that he was not yet ready to introduce to her. Things escalate when Robert gets Tennie's friends from school to participate in a focus group for a project, and in retaliation, Tennie throws a party at the house with almost half of the school showing up. A series of hilarious interactions between father and daughter ensues that starts to close the generational gap between them. What finally brings them together is a long overdue heart to heart conversation about past transgressions. One thing becomes certain, they will always have each other."

Johnson High School, a longstanding entry on Alabama's list of failing schools. Coached by teacher Chris Scribner, teammates Jailen, Jamario, Teague, and Jaquan each face challenges far beyond a shot at the State Championship: splintered family lives, drug use, teenage pregnancy, mental health struggles, and run-ins with the law threaten to derail their success on the mat and lock any doors that could otherwise open. Tough-love coach Scribner isn't off the hook, either; he must come to terms with his own past conflicts while unwittingly wading into the complexities of race, class and privilege in the South. Director Suzannah Herbert and Co-Director Lauren Belfer captured over 650 hours of footage during the course of the team's final season to create this closely observed, deeply affecting depiction of growing up disadvantaged in America today."

The son of a PGA veteran, the younger brother of a PGA rookie, he has all the talent in the world-but wants nothing to do with golf or the pressure of being the next in line. After Taylor purposely blows his tryout for the school team, his disappointed father takes a drive that ends in a texting-while-driving accident and lands him in a coma. Taylor blames himself and, with the guidance of his brother and the prayer support from his mother Jenny and newfound crush Bailey, makes it his mission to get back on the team and become the first freshman in state history to lead his team to a state championship. Faith, hope, and love bring Taylor and his family closer than ever and he learns that the greatest way to honor his father and his God is to embrace the gifts and talents he was given."

Behind the scenes Darrell suffered from debilitating flashbacks, self injury, addiction and misdiagnosis, until the right doctor isolated the key to unlocking the memories his brain kept locked away for over 50 years. Cracked Up, director Michelle Esrick, creates an inspiring balance between comedy and tragedy helping us understand the impact of toxic stress and childhood trauma in a new light, breaking down barriers of stigma and replacing shame with compassion and hope."

When he storms into Dyane's life, a graphic designer who falls for his charms, her son Marc immediately disapproves of this eccentric stranger in his mother's bed. But the studious teenager soon finds Yves' rebel ways contagious and begins to explore his own artistic side. Meanwhile, the poet feels increasingly trapped in his new life and decides to sabotage everything in a great outburst. Now alone at the end of the world, he realizes his words no longer mean anything. Freely inspired by the life and work of Quebec poet Yves Boisvert (1950-2012), For Those Who Don't Read Me tells the story of a man's quest for the absolute, fighting not to end up forgotten between two cookbooks."

",USA,English,Cohen Media Group,"Serendipity began as a book, published on the occasion of Prune Nourry's solo show at the Guimet National Asian Art Museum in Paris in 2017. The French-born, New York-based artist has spent the majority of her artistic career creating work that deals with women's bodies and female fertility. A recent breast cancer diagnosis led Nourry to create Serendipity-now in the form of a stunning first-person documentary-which captures the subsequent evolution of her body, her work, her soul, and her mind. This impassioned, beautiful film embodies the artist's belief that everything is connected, coincidence is an illusion, and ""the essentials to life really are health, love, and art."""

",USA,English,Grasshopper Film,"From director Andrew Rossi (Page One: Inside the New York Times, The First Monday in May) comes an electrifying portrait of writer and performer Okwui Okpokwasili and her acclaimed one-woman show, Bronx Gothic. Rooted in memories of her childhood, Okwui - who's worked with conceptual artists like Ralph Lemon and Julie Taymor - fuses dance, song, drama and comedy to create a mesmerizing space in which audiences can engage with a story about two 12-year-old black girls coming of age in the 1980s. With intimate v√©rit√© access to Okwui and her audiences off the stage, Bronx Gothic allows for unparalleled insight into her creative process as well as the complex social issues embodied in it."

Thompson, Steven Spielberg, Lynn Swann, Goldie Hawn, Abbie Hoffman, Lily Tomlin and more, ""TVTV: Video Revolutionaries"" is a new documentary about Top Value Television (TVTV), a band of merry video makers who, from 1972 to 1977, took the then brand-new portable video camera and journeyed out to document the world. In those days, there were only three TV networks, using giant studio cameras, and no one had ever seen a portable camera stuck in their face. Because the technology was so new, there were no rules about how to use it or what to make. So the new video journalists used it to make format-bending satirical shows about whatever interested them -- from the 1972 Republican Convention to an expose of a 15-year-old guru called ""Lord of the Universe"" to capturing the Steelers and Cowboys partying hard the night before Super Bowl X. Directed by TVTV alum Paul Goldsmith, the film is like opening a treasure chest into the 1970s, filled with cultural and political events hosted by now-famous characters who were then just beginning their climb to iconic."

In his documentary film Tosca's Kiss, which has developed an underground cult following over the years and is a favorite among opera and music lovers worldwide, director Daniel Schmid has captured a world in which these wonderful singers (many of whom had significant careers on the opera stage) re-live and re-enact their triumphant roles of the glorious past. Tosca's Kiss is a touching and often hilarious film on the subject of aging and the power and timeless capacity of music to inspire."
