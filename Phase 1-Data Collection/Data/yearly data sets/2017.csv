",USA,English,Fathom Events,"Steve McQueen truly is an American Icon. One of America's most endearing and intriguing movie stars, he ""is still the King of Cool"" according to Esquire Magazine-50 years after the zenith of his career. The strangest thing about him, however, is barely known, despite countless biographies and articles. Steve McQueen was a believer in Jesus Christ. On the surface McQueen had everything he could want-fame, cars, homes, more money than he could spend in a lifetime. An avid fan of the actor (and owner of a replica of McQueen's car in the classic film Bullitt), Pastor Greg Laurie hits the road in his mint Mustang, traveling the country in search of the true, untold story of McQueen's redemption-filled final chapters."

",Japan,Japanese,Eleven Arts,"Fiore, an old friend from Mamoru's lonely childhood who couldn't survive on Earth, returns with flowers he promised Mamoru. But, the evil flower Kisenian overpowered Fiore's weak mind and manipulated him into spreading Kisenian's seeds over Earth in an effort to drain energy from everyone on Earth. Kisenian manages to do this because he's deceived Fiore using Fiore's long-lost friendship with Mamoru. It is up to Sailor Moon and the Sailor Senshi to stop Kisenian."

","Spain
USA",English,Fathom Events,"It all started with three little words. I'll Push You is an up-close and personal look into the dynamics of a life-long friendship between of two best friends - Justin Skeesuck and Patrick Gray - as they travel across El Camino de Santiago. This feature-length documentary covers the struggle of the 34-day, 500-mile hike across mountains, deserts, hills, and valleys and features perspectives from family and friends. Even though the story begins with the challenges that come with Patrick's answering of the invitation to push Justin in a wheelchair across northern Spain, it also explores the struggles related to Justin's rare neurological disease. The parallel paths of Patrick's experience in Spain and Justin's life journey come together in a singular moment to reveal to Patrick something unezpected. The story's beautiful cinematography is set to poignant music tracks that underscore, perfectly, the inspiring example of generosity and vulnerability on display. The film is an intimate portrait of an epic journey and explores the true meaning of friendship, generosity, and vulnerability. It's a one-of-a-kind documentary chronicling their pilgrimage, which will resonate with viewers craving stories of faith, hope, love, and the power of community. Their trek in 2014 captured the imagination of the world and was featured in the Huffington Post, The Meredith Vieira Show, Der Spiegel, Fox and Friends, and many other outlets. Since their return from Spain, the subjects of the film are sharing their message of hope, faith, and community worldwide."

But when she's served an eviction notice, the specter of retirement prompts Sonia to revisit her harrowing past as a refugee and witness to genocide.

Through her, Lance finds hope, relearning the joys of life and living despite the outwardly bedeviled society in which they find themselves."

",China,Mandarin,China Lion Film Distribution,"An estimated 200,000 Chinese women were forced into prostitution by the Japanese army during WWII. Only 22 of them remain today to speak out publicly. This documentary is not a film for political gains or narrow nationalistic purposes. For the director and the crew, each and every one of those elderly women is a brave and strong individual with similar yet distinctive experiences. This is a group that deserves to be known and correctly understood by more people and a history worth being preserved in a most accurate yet sensitive way. In the documentary, the current situation of those 22 elderly women will be presented in an impersonal way. There's no interrogation, sympathy, nor exaggeration in our film. You will hear them talk about their own experiences, and you will also learn about their perspectives on life, sufferings and happiness. Now all over 80 or 90 years old, those elderly ladies are at the very last stage of their life. This is probably the last chance for the public to actually see their situations and hear their own words while they are still alive. It should not be a history just written on pages."

Following the possibly real-life exploits of Josh Kornbluth, an autobiographical monologist, Love & Taxes is a comedy that blends solo performance and scripted scenes to bring the subjective reality of the storyteller hilariously to life. A tale of procrastination, making movies and growing up, Love & Taxes is a middle-aged coming-of-age story that is also, quite possibly, the first ever pro-tax romantic comedy."

",France,French,Big World Pictures,"Luc Bondy's final feature film as director draws talent from both stage and screen to bring Pierre de Marivaux's 1737 play into 21st century Paris. Isabelle Huppert commands the screen as Araminte, the wealthy widow who unwittingly hires the smitten Dorante (Louis Garrel) as her accountant. Secrets and lies accumulate as Dorante and his accomplice, Araminte's manservant Dubois (Yves Jacques), manipulate not only the good-hearted Araminte, but also her friend and confidante, Marton (Manon Combes). Dorante, by turns pitiable and proficient, but always deferential to his social better, walks a fine line in his quest to arouse an equal desire in the object of his affections. Bulle Ogier delivers a memorable turn as Araminte's mother, who suspects the young man's intentions, but wants to push her daughter into the arms of an aged, hard-up Count (Jean-Pierre Malo). Filmed in part on-site at the Théâtre de l'Odéon-and shot during the daytime, while the same cast performed the play there at night-the film blurs the distinction between stage and screen, offering a new turn on this classic take on the psychology of love."

Rooted in memories of her childhood, Okwui - who's worked with conceptual artists like Ralph Lemon and Julie Taymor - fuses dance, song, drama and comedy to create a mesmerizing space in which audiences can engage with a story about two 12-year-old black girls coming of age in the 1980s. With intimate vérité access to Okwui and her audiences off the stage, Bronx Gothic allows for unparalleled insight into her creative process as well as the complex social issues embodied in it."

The Freedom to Marry movement is now known as one of the most successful civil rights campaigns in the modern history, but change did not arrive by happenstance. This victory was carefully planned and orchestrated over decades. THE FREEDOM TO MARRY, a new documentary film, offers the untold, inside story of this historic movement. This is a riveting ride alongside Evan Wolfson and Mary Bonauto, the architect and the main litigator of the movement, and their key colleagues from earliest days of their journey to their final frenetic dash to the US Supreme Court."

The company has performed in over 500 cities and 33 countries, and has a cult following around the world. The film juxtaposes exclusive, behind-the-scenes access and intimate, character-driven stories of its dancers, highlighted by amazing performances shot around the world. Rebels on Pointe ultimately celebrates our shared humanity through universal themes of identity, dreams, family, love, loss, determination and resilience... proving that a ballerina is not merely a woman dancing, but an act of revolution in a tutu."

Moving through the corridors and bowels of the enormous and disorientating structure, the camera takes the viewer on a journey to a place of dehumanising physical labor and intense hardship, provoking cause for thought about persistent pre-industrial working conditions and the huge divide between first world and developing countries. Since the 1960s the area of Sachin in western India has undergone unprecedented, unregulated industrialisation, exemplified in its numerous textile factories. MACHINES portraits only one of these factories, while at the same time representing the thousands of labourers working, living and suffering in an environment they can't escape without unity. With strong visual language, memorable images and carefully selected interviews of the workers themselves, Jain tells a story of inequality and oppression, humans and machines."

",USA,English,Entertainment Studios Motion Pictures,"Director Lysa Heslov's documentary, ""Served Like a Girl, provides a candid look at several American women as they transition from active duty to civilian life after serving tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our wounded U.S. female service personnel often return to a stark reality, one that is rarely discussed or considered. Struggling with PTSD, homelessness, broken families, serious illness, physical injuries, and the aftermath of military sexual abuse, these amazing women find ways to adapt and overcome debilitating challenges through participation in the ""Ms. Veteran America"" competition. Guided by event founder and veteran, Jas Boothe, the women leverage their experiences gained through competition to recover the parts of themselves and their personal identities they had lost on the battlefield. Called ""Engaging, Honest and Powerful,"" this film is a beautiful tapestry interlaced with poignant moments, social commentary, and humor."

",USA,English,GathrFilms,"Dying to Know is an intimate portrait celebrating two very complex controversial characters in an epic friendship that shaped a generation. In the early 1960s Harvard psychology professors Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert began probing the edges of consciousness through their experiments with psychedelics. Leary became the LSD guru, asking us to think for ourselves, igniting a global counter-cultural movement and landing in prison after Nixon called him 'the most dangerous man in America'. Alpert journeyed to the East becoming Ram Dass, a spiritual teacher for an entire generation who continues in his 80s teaching service through compassion. With interviews spanning 50 years the film invites us into the future encouraging us to ponder questions about life, drugs & the biggest mystery of all: death."

While her mother (Kelly Lynch), like astronaut Michael Collins, goes to the dark side of the moon for a leukemia treatment, Ella must journey on her own to the strange moon of her grandmother's world. Ella's father, (Sean Patrick Flanery) orbits his daughter, as Ella befriends Miguel and Rosie to find acceptance of her mother's fate. Emotional connections are reshaped, and the music of Patrick Neil Doyle helps tell this unusual story. In an era when many actresses are speaking about the dearth of women in various production roles, behind the scenes of this family film were many women - the director, the DoP, the Editor, the PPS, and 3 of the 4 credited screenwriters. This was the result of finding the best people for the project. Additionally, there was a great range of roles for women of all ages in Kepler's Dream."

",USA,English,Icarus Films,"A racially-charged criminal trial and a heart-rending love story converge in this documentary about Richard and Mildred Loving, set during the turbulent Civil Rights era. Long Way Home: The Loving Story is a story of love and the struggle for dignity set against a backdrop of historic anti-miscegenation sentiments in the U.S. The Lovings, an interracial couple, fell in love and married at a critical time in American history, and, because of a confluence of social and political turmoil our reluctant heroes bring about change where previously no one else could. They are paired with two young and ambitious lawyers who are driven to pave the way for Civil Rights and social justice through an historic Supreme Court ruling, changing the country's story forever."

Famed as a place that wants you dead, this film follows a rag tag team of field biologists to some of the harshest corners of the planet, where they track the impact of climate change and ocean health by counting penguin populations. From the tip of Argentina to the ominous Deception Island, 'The Penguin Counters' is a treacherous, heart warming journey by a 21st century Dr. Doliitle who dreams of conserving this stunning but fragile region for future generations."
